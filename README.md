  ## Description:
  This command line application takes in information about employees and then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
 ## Installation:
  The user must run 'npm install' to install all dependencies.  
  ## Usage:
  The user must run 'node app.js' first to start the application, then will be asked to enter information about the manager employee. Afterwards, the user will have the option to add an Engineer and Intern or decide not to add more employees. If the user selects either Engineer or Intern, the user must enter information about either employee through a series of prompts. Once the user decides to not add employees the employee roster will appear as team.html in the output folder. The user must open team.html in their default browser and the page for the user's team will display.
